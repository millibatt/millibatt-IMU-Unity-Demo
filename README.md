### Precautions for Safe Operation
1. Motion sensor and Nimbus 9 battery are small and present a choking hazard. Keep them stored safely away from children and animals.
2. Store the Motion sensor at room temperature. Avoid contact with any liquids.
3. Keep the battery in use in Motion sensor. Keep the extra batteries in the plastic case provided for the battery individually. Do not store in the same container. Do not place the battery on the metal surface. Handle with provided plastic tweezers only. Do not handle with metal tweezers. This will create external short and potential sparks, heating, of the battery.
4. Use correct battery polarity. The narrow face of the battery is the negative (-) terminal. The wide and flat face is the positive (+) terminal. Make sure the battery is loaded with the negative (-) terminal facing the circuit board and the positive (+) terminal touching the outer part of the battery holder.
